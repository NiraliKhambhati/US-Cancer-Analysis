# US-Cancer-Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes cancer data across different states in United States using a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes information on cancer rates, population statistics, and demographic breakdown for various types of Cancer.

## Data
The dataset used in this project is "Cancer.csv" from Kaggle, which contains comprehensive cancer statistics for all 51 states (inlcuding the District of Columbia) in the United States. Ket features for all the dataset includes:
- Total cancer rates and numbers per state
- Age-specific rates (<18, 18-45, 45-64, >64)
- Gender-specific rates
- Race-specific rates
- Detailed statistics for lung cancer

## Project Structure
The project is organized as a Jupyter notebook, utilizing Python for data analysis. Key libraries used include:
- Numpy for numerical computations
- Pandas for data manipulations and analysis

## Analysis Highllights
- The average total cancer rate across states is approximately 190.66 per 100,000 population.
- There is significant variation in cancer rates among states, ranging from 98.5 to 254.6 per 100,000.
- The analysis includes breakdowns by age groups, sex, race, and specific cancer types, with a focus on lung cancer.

## Getting Started
To run this project:
1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
2. Install required Python libraries: 'Numpy' and 'Pandas'.
3. Download the 'cancer.csv' dataset from Kaggle.
4. Place the dataset in the appropriate input directory.
5. Open and run the Jupyter notebook.

## Future Work
Potential areas for expanding this analysis include:
- Visualization of geographic trends
- Time series analysis if temporal data become available.
- Machine learning models for predicting cancer rates based on demographic factors.
